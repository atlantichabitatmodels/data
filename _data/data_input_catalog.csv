aquamaps,AquaMaps,"Standardized distribution maps for over 33,500 species of fishes, marine mammals and invertebrates.","Standardized distribution maps for over 33,500 species of fishes, marine mammals and invertebrates. AquaMaps is a joint project of FishBase and SealifeBase.
AquaMaps is a tool for generating model-based, large-scale predictions of natural occurrences of marine species. The model uses estimates of environmental preferences with respect to depth, water temperature, salinity, primary productivity, dissolved oxygen, and association with sea ice or coastal areas. These estimates of species preferences, called environmental envelopes, are derived from large sets of occurrence data available from online collection databases such as GBIF (gbif.org) and OBIS (obis.org), and from independent knowledge from the literature about the distribution of a given species and its habitat usage that are available in FishBase (www.fishbase.org) and in SeaLifeBase (www.sealifebase.org). The environmental envelopes are matched against local environmental conditions to determine the suitability of a given area in the ocean for a particular species. Predictions of relative probabilities of species occurrence are shown as color-coded species range maps in a global grid of half-degree latitude and longitude cell dimensions. The maps are displayed on the web through the use of C-squares Mapper developed at CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research in Australia (Rees, 2002, 2003).

The data can be in the form of vectors, rasters, aerial photography or statistical tabular data and most often the data component can be very costly or labor intensive. But it doesn’t always have to be that way, as there are plenty of great resources available that offer free Canadian open data that you can use with your geomatics projects to generate geospatial products. In fact more and more are popping up all over the web and some cities like Ottawa are even having contests to help promote the use of their data.

Over the past few years we have been highlighting and promoting various cities and provinces in Canada that have done a great job providing Open Geospatial Data and geospatial applications to the public. During that time there has been plenty of great praise, feedback and emails regarding these efforts in helping to promote Canadian geospatial data and ensuring that everybody in the geomatics community knows where to find data for their projects.

canfootprint,Canadian Human Footprint Index,Canadian human footprint map that combines twelve different anthropogenic pressures and identify intact and modified lands and ecosystems across the country. ,"Efforts are underway in Canada to set aside terrestrial lands for conservation, thereby protecting them from anthropogenic pressures. Here we produce the first Canadian human footprint map by combining twelve different anthropogenic pressures and identify intact and modified lands and ecosystems across the country. Our results showed strong spatial variation in pressures across the country, with just 18% of Canada experiencing measurable human pressure. However, some ecosystems are experiencing very high pressure, such as the Great Lakes Plains and Prairies national ecological areas which have over 75% and 56% of their areas, respectively, with a high human footprint. In contrast, the Arctic and Northern Mountains have less than 0.02% and 0.2% of their extent under high human footprint. A validation of the final map, using random statistical sampling, resulted in a Cohen Kappa statistic of 0.91, signifying an ‘almost perfect’ agreement between the human footprint and the validation data set. By increasing the number and accuracy of mapped pressures, our map demonstrates much more widespread pressures in Canada than were indicated by previous global mapping efforts, demonstrating the value in specific national data applications. Ecological areas with immense anthropogenic pressure, highlight challenges that may arise when planning for ecologically representative protected areas.",not applicable,Terrestrial,https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP2/EVKAVL,Free,,Canada,Raster,environmental,Dataset,300 m,Organization,,,Jocelyn,false,false,false,environmental_subset,false,007,data_item,inputs,/img/derivatives/simple/canfootprint/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/canfootprint/fullwidth.jpg

In 2010, results from 10 years of FEC project work were synthesized to produce a comprehensive provincial FEC guide which is presented in three documents: Forest Ecosystem Classification for Nova Scotia: Part I Vegetation Types (2010); Part II Soil Types (2010); and Part III Ecosites (2010).

Starting in 2009, the Earth Observation Team of the Science and Technology Branch (STB) at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) began the process of generating annual crop type digital maps. Focusing on the Prairie Provinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was applied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (Radarsat-2) based satellite images. Beginning with the 2011 growing season, this activity has been extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory. To date this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets the overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of 30m (56m in 2009 and 2010).

Based largely on data from the Landsat series of satellites, free and open access to analysis ready data, and utilization of high performance computing, NTEMS enabled the recreation of the history of Canada's forests at a higher level of spatial and categorical detail than ever before. Through NTEMS research, methods have been developed for image compositing, change detection, and change attribution using Landsat time series data. NTEMS outputs have subsequently enabled the characterization of post-disturbance recovery, an annual land cover data cube, and national representations of forest structure.

These lists are rich in information obtained during status assessment and recovery planning processes, ranging from biological attributes to actions that support recovery. Data compiled from species lists allow for analyses, including assessing trends in threats, prioritizing actions, and identifying barriers to achieving recovery objectives. For legally protected species at risk of extinction in Canada, such analyses are challenging owing to a lack of comprehensive and accessible data reflecting information compiled from listing and recovery documents. To encourage ongoing synthesis and minimise duplication of efforts, we initiated CAN-SAR: a database of Canadian Species at Risk information. This transparent, open-access, and searchable database contains information transcribed from listing documents, including listing date, and derived variables. Derived variables required interpretation for which we developed standardised criteria to record information, including classification of recovery actions. The CAN-SAR database is updateable, and will contribute towards improved recovery planning to safeguard species of conservation concern.",species at risk,Marine|Freshwater|Terrestrial,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01381-8#Sec6,Free,,Canada,Unknown,species at risk|occurrence,Database,,Individual,,,,false,false,false,false,occurrence_subset,074,data_item,inputs,/img/derivatives/simple/cansar/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/cansar/fullwidth.jpg
