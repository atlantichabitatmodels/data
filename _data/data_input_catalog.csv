aquamaps,AquaMaps,"Standardized distribution maps for over 33,500 species of fishes, marine mammals and invertebrates. AquaMaps is a joint project of FishBase and SealifeBase.
AquaMaps is a tool for generating model-based, large-scale predictions of natural occurrences of marine species. The model uses estimates of environmental preferences with respect to depth, water temperature, salinity, primary productivity, dissolved oxygen, and association with sea ice or coastal areas. These estimates of species preferences, called environmental envelopes, are derived from large sets of occurrence data available from online collection databases such as GBIF (gbif.org) and OBIS (obis.org), and from independent knowledge from the literature about the distribution of a given species and its habitat usage that are available in FishBase (www.fishbase.org) and in SeaLifeBase (www.sealifebase.org). The environmental envelopes are matched against local environmental conditions to determine the suitability of a given area in the ocean for a particular species. Predictions of relative probabilities of species occurrence are shown as color-coded species range maps in a global grid of half-degree latitude and longitude cell dimensions. The maps are displayed on the web through the use of C-squares Mapper developed at CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research in Australia (Rees, 2002, 2003).

cangis,Canadian GIS,"Canadian Open Data and Free Geospatial Data Resources: Almost anyone in the geospatial community would agree that a major part of any GIS project would be the data sets involved. The data can be in the form of vectors, rasters, aerial photography or statistical tabular data and most often the data component can be very costly or labor intensive. But it doesn’t always have to be that way, as there are plenty of great resources available that offer free Canadian open data that you can use with your geomatics projects to generate geospatial products. In fact more and more are popping up all over the web and some cities like Ottawa are even having contests to help promote the use of their data.

Over the past few years we have been highlighting and promoting various cities and provinces in Canada that have done a great job providing Open Geospatial Data and geospatial applications to the public. During that time there has been plenty of great praise, feedback and emails regarding these efforts in helping to promote Canadian geospatial data and ensuring that everybody in the geomatics community knows where to find data for their projects.

We started this page in 2010 as a way to collaborate links to all Canadian Open Data (sites that offer data downloads at no cost and without restrictions), free geospatial data, online web mapping applications and other sources of geospatial information (including National, Provincial and Municipal levels).",,Marine|Freshwater|Terrestrial,https://canadiangis.com/data.php,Open,https://canadiangis.com/contact,Canada,,Environmental,Data portal,,Organization,,Jocelyn,https://canadiangis.com/wp-content/uploads/CanadianGIS-rec-logo-2021-v4-705x262.png,06,data_item,inputs,/img/derivatives/simple/cangis/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/cangis/fullwidth.jpg
canfootprint,Canadian Human Footprint Index,"Efforts are underway in Canada to set aside terrestrial lands for conservation, thereby protecting them from anthropogenic pressures. Here we produce the first Canadian human footprint map by combining twelve different anthropogenic pressures and identify intact and modified lands and ecosystems across the country. Our results showed strong spatial variation in pressures across the country, with just 18% of Canada experiencing measurable human pressure. However, some ecosystems are experiencing very high pressure, such as the Great Lakes Plains and Prairies national ecological areas which have over 75% and 56% of their areas, respectively, with a high human footprint. In contrast, the Arctic and Northern Mountains have less than 0.02% and 0.2% of their extent under high human footprint. A validation of the final map, using random statistical sampling, resulted in a Cohen Kappa statistic of 0.91, signifying an ‘almost perfect’ agreement between the human footprint and the validation data set. By increasing the number and accuracy of mapped pressures, our map demonstrates much more widespread pressures in Canada than were indicated by previous global mapping efforts, demonstrating the value in specific national data applications. Ecological areas with immense anthropogenic pressure, highlight challenges that may arise when planning for ecologically representative protected areas.",,,https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP2/EVKAVL,Open,,Canada,Raster,Environmental,Dataset,300 m,Organization,,Jocelyn,https://borealisdata.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=106023&version=3.1,07,data_item,inputs,/img/derivatives/simple/canfootprint/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/canfootprint/fullwidth.jpg
