description: The US. long-term ecological research network consists of 28 research
  programs with a rich history of ecological inquiry and collaboration. Bringing together
  diverse groups of researchers with sustained data collection and ecosystem manipulation
  experiments, these sites allow each new generation of scientists to apply new tools
  and explore new questions in systems where the context is well understood, shared,
  and thoroughly documented. Site profiles contain key information on research, history,
  people, institutional affiliations, and location for each LTER site as well as links
  to additional site information.
