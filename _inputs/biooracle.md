  Marine data layers for ecological modelling
  Bio-ORACLE is a set of GIS rasters providing geophysical, biotic and environmental data for surface and benthic marine realms.
  The data are available for global-scale applications at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin (approximately 9.2 km at the equator).
  The most recent Representative Concentration Pathways are provided in order to model the ecological implications of future changes.
