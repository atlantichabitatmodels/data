pid: unbbourque
label: Datasets in Support of Climate Change Tree Species Modelling
short_description: 'Spatial environmental datasets generated for research purposes:
  incident photosynthetically active radiation, growing degree days (an index of heat
  accumulation), and soil water content.'
description: Spatial estimates of PAR and SWC are obtained with an existing process-based
  model, the Landscape Distribution of Soil moisture, Energy, and Temperature model
  (LanDSET). GDD and average air temperature are estimated from remote sensing data
  derived primarily from MODIS and Landsat-7 ETM+ optical and thermal (infra-red)
  image data. Average air temperature and annual precipitation (presented as an interpolation
  of climate station precipitation measurements) serve as input to the calculation
  of SWC in LanDSET.
