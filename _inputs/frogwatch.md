short_description: Citizen science project to monitor frogs.
description: Frogs and toads are an important part of local biodiversity – the amazing
  variety of life around us! Conserving biodiversity is essential to the health of
  the planet and the welfare of humankind. Frogs and toads have a special role to
  play in keeping the environment healthy. With their semi-permeable skin and their
  ability to live “on the edge” between water and land, frogs and toads are very sensitive
  to pollution and other environmental changes. By participating in this program you
  will help increase our scientific knowledge of frogs and toads in Canada.
