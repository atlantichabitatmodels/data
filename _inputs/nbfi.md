  a highly detailed inventory of the forest to determine what the forest looks like
  across the province’s landscape. Tree species, size, quality, and quantity (volume);
  and broad forest types are included in the inventory. The provincial forest inventory
  is done on a 10-year cycle. Harvest, silvicultural and natural disturbance updates
  are added to the inventory annually to ensure the most current information is available.
  The forest inventory is the foundation of all sustainable forest management, land
  use planning and policy decision making.\n\n"
