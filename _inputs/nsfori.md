description: 'It is important to describe the forests of Nova Scotia today, including
  how they are changing over time. The Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources
  (NSNR&R) forest inventory program monitors many elements of today''s natural resources
  and thereby captures changes over time. The inventory data helps us make informed
  choices on sustainable forest management. The forests of Nova Scotia are monitored
  by two complementary measurement systems: Photo Interpretation and Permanent Forest
  Inventory Plots (Inventory Services). Data analysis is used to define and track
  many forest components, such as volume and growth, and results in various reports.
  The data also provides a basis for modeling volume, biomass and carbon. This valuable
  database is regularly shared with academia, industry and other governments.'
