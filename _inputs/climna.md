pid: climna
label: ClimateNA
description: ClimateNA is a standalone MS Windows application that downscales PRISM
  (Daly et al. 2008) 1971-2000 gridded monthly climate normal data (800 x 800 m) to
  scale-free point locations. It calculates and derives many (>200) monthly, seasonal
  and annual climate variables. ClimateNA also uses the scale-free data as a baseline
  to downscale historical and future climate variables for individual years and periods
  between 1901 and 2100. ClimateNA covers entire North America (shown below)
