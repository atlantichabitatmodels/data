description: This site explores the relationship between plants and climate across
  Canada. One portion of the site is dedicated to plant hardiness zone maps, which
  have traditionally been used by gardeners to help select which plant species to
  grow in their area. Another part of the site presents maps and models that summarize
  the climatic requirements of thousands of plants from across North America. A final
  aspect of the site gathers data and provides summaries about plants that occur in
  your area.
