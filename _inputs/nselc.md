description: |-
  An Ecological Land Classification (ELC) is a mapping tool that identifies and describes areas of similar enduring physical attributes. It is based on features such as climate, elevation, topography, bedrock formation, and vegetation. Within the classification information is presented and mapped within a hierarchy where broad to specific levels of detail are presented on a series of scale dependant maps.
  The ELC is a useful tool for landscape level planning and sustainable management of forests, conservation, wildlife and other land use issues.
