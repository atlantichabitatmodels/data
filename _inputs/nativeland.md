description: Native Land is an app to help map Indigenous territories, treaties, and
  languages. We strive to map Indigenous lands in a way that changes, challenges,
  and improves the way people see history and the present day. We hope to strengthen
  the spiritual bonds that people have with the land, its people, and its meaning.
