  we initiated CAN-SAR: a database of Canadian Species at Risk information.'
description: 'Threatened species lists describe the conservation status of species
  and are key tools used to inform decisions for biodiversity conservation. These
  lists are rich in information obtained during status assessment and recovery planning
  processes, ranging from biological attributes to actions that support recovery.
  Data compiled from species lists allow for analyses, including assessing trends
  in threats, prioritizing actions, and identifying barriers to achieving recovery
  objectives. For legally protected species at risk of extinction in Canada, such
  analyses are challenging owing to a lack of comprehensive and accessible data reflecting
  information compiled from listing and recovery documents. To encourage ongoing synthesis
  and minimise duplication of efforts, we initiated CAN-SAR: a database of Canadian
  Species at Risk information. This transparent, open-access, and searchable database
  contains information transcribed from listing documents, including listing date,
  and derived variables. Derived variables required interpretation for which we developed
  standardised criteria to record information, including classification of recovery
  actions. The CAN-SAR database is updateable, and will contribute towards improved
  recovery planning to safeguard species of conservation concern.'
