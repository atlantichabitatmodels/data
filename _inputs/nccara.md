  integrity of freshwater ecosystems.
description: 'NCC''s Active River Area for the Northern Appalachian - Acadian Region.
  Conserving and restoring healthy stream and river ecosystems requires an integrated
  approach that not only focuses on the streams and rivers themselves, but also incorporates
  adjacent floodplains and riparian areas and the dynamic processes that directly
  link the two. Examples of these natural processes include hydrologic flow regime,
  sediment transport, turnover of organic matter, habitat connectivity, and maintaining
  water quality, among others. While the type and degree of influence that these processes
  have on streams and rivers varies in both time and space, by spatially delineating
  the full range of landscape features that contribute to these processes, the ARA
  provides a framework for conserving and restoring the ecological integrity of freshwater
  ecosystems. For more background information on the original Active River Area project,
  including applications and utility, please refer to The Active River Area: A Conservation
  Framework for Protecting Rivers and Streams (Smith et al., 2008).'
