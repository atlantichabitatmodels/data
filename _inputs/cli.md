description: The Canada Land Inventory is a comprehensive multi-disciplinary land
  inventory of rural Canada, covering over 2.5 million square kilometers of land and
  water. Land capability for agriculture, forestry, wildlife, recreation, wildlife
  (ungulates and waterfowl) was mapped. Over 1000 mapsheets at the 1:250,000 scale
  were created during the 1960's, 70s, and early 80's. Although the information is
  old, and better information is available for some areas as part of more recent soil
  surveys, the interpretations are still largely valid, and many jurisdictions still
  use them for land use planning purposes.
