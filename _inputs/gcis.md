description: The Global Change Information System (GCIS); a product of the U.S. Global
  Change Research Program (USGCRP); is an open-source, web-based resource designed
  for use by scientists, decision makers, and the public. As a centralized catalog
  of all materials and data used for USGCRP products and climate assessments; the
  system acts as an advanced, multifaceted bibliography, maintaining traceable provenance
  records of scientific information and providing access to the original data and
  research. The GCIS documents the cross-links among research papers, researchers,
  original data, and more and includes links back to authoritative sources for its
  information. In addition, the GCIS guides users to global change research produced
  by the 14 USGCRP member agencies.
