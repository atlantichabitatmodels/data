description: The National Forest Inventory (NFI) is being implemented to assess and
  monitor the extent, state, and sustainable development of Canada's forests in a
  timely and accurate manner. Information is collected to a set of uniform standards,
  enabling consistent reporting across the country on the extent and state of Canada's
  land base to establish a baseline of where the forest resources are and how they
  are changing over time. In addition to providing consistent estimates for traditional
  forest inventory attributes, the NFI provides a framework for collecting additional
  data relevant to sustainable development, forest health, biodiversity and forest
  productivity.
