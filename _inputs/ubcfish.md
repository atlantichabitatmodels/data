description: The UBC Fish Collection holds over 850,000 specimens and over 50,000
  DNA and tissue samples making it the third-largest fish collection in Canada. These
  fish specimens are described in over 11,200 records that contain data on species
  co-occurrences and habitat and environmental conditions associated with each collection
  over a more than 100 year period. The "fish notebooks" that contain these collection
  records provide an invaluable biological time series and context for each collection.
  The data have been used in environmental assessments, conservation efforts, and
  numerous research projects such as documenting regime shifts in the Bering Sea,
  the formation of new species, and the extinction of others as well as in educating
  and training some of Canada's leading fish biologists. This digitization project
  make this data globally accessible. See more about the Fish Collection at the Beaty
  Biodiversity Museum.
