description: "Standardized distribution maps for over 33,500 species of fishes, marine
  mammals and invertebrates. AquaMaps is a joint project of FishBase and SealifeBase.\nAquaMaps
  is a tool for generating model-based, large-scale predictions of natural occurrences
  of marine species. The model uses estimates of environmental preferences with respect
  to depth, water temperature, salinity, primary productivity, dissolved oxygen, and
  association with sea ice or coastal areas. These estimates of species preferences,
  called environmental envelopes, are derived from large sets of occurrence data available
  from online collection databases such as GBIF (gbif.org) and OBIS (obis.org), and
  from independent knowledge from the literature about the distribution of a given
  species and its habitat usage that are available in FishBase (www.fishbase.org)
  and in SeaLifeBase (www.sealifebase.org). The environmental envelopes are matched
  against local environmental conditions to determine the suitability of a given area
  in the ocean for a particular species. Predictions of relative probabilities of
  species occurrence are shown as color-coded species range maps in a global grid
  of half-degree latitude and longitude cell dimensions. The maps are displayed on
  the web through the use of C-squares Mapper developed at CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric
  Research in Australia (Rees, 2002, 2003). \n"
