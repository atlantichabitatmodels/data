description: 'This feature layer depicts the watershed boundaries of Canada and provides
  a detailed look at drainage areas and water flow for the entire land mass of Canada.
  This map service references the Water Survey of Canada (WSC) data. The WSC has a
  3-level hierarchy of drainage areas established in 1927 for the purpose of managing
  hydrometric stations (recording water levels or rates of flow). They are: Major
  Drainage Areas, Sub Drainage Areas and Sub-sub Drainage Areas. This map service
  includes all three drainage area boundaries as well as the highest order boundary,
  the ocean drainage area.'
