pid: trspincafoec
label: Tree Species in Canada's Forested Ecosystems
short_description: 37 tree species mapped over forest-dominated ecosystems of Canada.
description: Highly detailed (30-m spatial resolution) tree species presence and distribution
  maps of Canada’s forested ecosystems (2019). Products include the leading tree species
  as well as the class membership probabilities for 37 tree species. Also shared is
  the distance-to-second class (D2SC) provided as an indicator of attribution confidence.
  These layers were produced from a 2019 Landsat image composite, geographic and climate
  data, elevation derivatives, and remote sensing derived phenology. Regional classification
  models were generated based on Canada’s National Forest Inventory using a 150x150
  km tiling system.
