description: The 2020 AAFC Land Use is a culmination and curated metaanalysis of several
  high-quality spatial datasets produced between 1990 and 2021 using a variety of
  methods by teams of researchers as techniques and capabilities have evolved. The
  information from the input datasets was consolidated and embedded within each 30m
  x 30m pixel to create consolidated pixel histories, resulting in thousands of unique
  combinations of evidence ready for careful consideration. Informed by many sources
  of high-quality evidence and visual observation of imagery in Google Earth, we apply
  an incremental strategy to develop a coherent best current understanding of what
  has happened in each pixel through the time series.
