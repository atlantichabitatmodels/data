description: 'The National Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring System (NTEMS) was developed
  by the Canadian Forest Service to provide national-scale baseline information on
  Canada''s forested ecosystems. Based largely on data from the Landsat series of
  satellites, free and open access to analysis ready data, and utilization of high
  performance computing, NTEMS enabled the recreation of the history of Canada''s
  forests at a higher level of spatial and categorical detail than ever before. Through
  NTEMS research, methods have been developed for image compositing, change detection,
  and change attribution using Landsat time series data. NTEMS outputs have subsequently
  enabled the characterization of post-disturbance recovery, an annual land cover
  data cube, and national representations of forest structure. When using this data,
