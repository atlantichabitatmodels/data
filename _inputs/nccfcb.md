  Canada.
description: 'This gallery showcases the Nature Conservancy of Canada''s (NCC) Freshwater
  Conservation Blueprint for the Northern Appalachian–Acadian Region of Canada. The
  Freshwater Conservation Blueprint is composed of five planning tools: (1) a stream
  and river ecosystem classification (2) a watershed health assessment; (3) an aquatic
  connectivity tool; (4) an Active River Area delineation; (5) a freshwater resilience
  assessment. These tools collectively aim to assist in setting freshwater conservation
  and restoration priorities throughout the region, and to promote on-the-ground (and
  in-the-water) action. All these tools are designed to be applicable at multiple
  spatial scales, from individual watershed, to the provincial level, and to the region
  as a whole. We envision the Freshwater Conservation Blueprint enabling organizations
  of all sizes and mandates to work collaboratively using a common language and consistent
  data to help guide freshwater conservation and management.'
