description: NCC's Aquatic Connectivity Tool for the Northern Appalachian - Acadian
  Region of Canada is designed to assess the relative impacts of aquatic barriers
  across watersheds in the Maritimes and eastern Quebec. The tool allows users to
  input ground-truthed passability scores for dams, culverts and other crossings,
  and prioritize barriers that will have the greatest positive impact for fish and
  other aquatic wildlife if removed or restored. Users can choose the scale at which
  they run analyses (e.g. local catchment, primary watershed, entire province, etc.),
  as well as the ecological communities to benefit from restoration activities (e.g.
  diadromous fish, resident species). Additionally, 34 different metrics are available
  for custom-designed scenarios, allowing users to define their own priorities.
