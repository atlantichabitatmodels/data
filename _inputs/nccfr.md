description: NCC's Freshwater Resilience for the Northern Appalachian - Acadian Region
  GIS dataset is designed to spatially identify functionally connected networks that
  are most likely to be resilient in the face of climate change, and therefore maintain
  their full suite of biodiversity. The intended uses of the classification include,
  (1) providing common data across provincial and state boundaries to facilitate collaborative
  opportunities, (2) improving provincial-scale freshwater conservation and sustainable
  management by providing aquatic planning tools where none previously existed, (3)
  generating new knowledge on aquatic biodiversity patterns, (4) supporting the development
  of other aquatic tools to assess aquatic health, determine conservation and restoration
  priorities, and facilitate climate change adaptation planning.
