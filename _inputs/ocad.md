description: OceanAdapt is a collaboration between the Pinsky Lab of Rutgers University,
  the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)
  to provide information about the impacts of changing climate and other factors on
  the distribution of marine life to the National Climate Assessment, fisheries communities,
  policymakers, and to others. This website hosts an annually updated database of
  scientific surveys in the United States and Canada, providing tools for exploring
  changes in marine fish and invertebrate distributions. We are continually working
  to expand the site with new data and visualization tools.
