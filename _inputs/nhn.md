description: The National Hydro Network (NHN) focuses on providing a quality geometric
  description and a set of basic attributes describing Canada's inland surface waters.
  It provides geospatial digital data compliant with the NHN Standard such as lakes,
  reservoirs, watercourses (rivers and streams), canals, islands, drainage linear
  network, toponyms or geographical names, constructions and obstacles related to
  surface waters, etc. The best available federal and provincial data are used for
  its production, which is done jointly by the federal and interested provincial and
  territorial partners. The NHN is created from existing data at the 1:50 000 scale
  or better. The NHN data have a great potential for analysis, cartographic representation
  and display and will serve as base data in many applications. The NHN Work Unit
  Limits were created based on Water Survey of Canada Sub-Sub-Drainage Area
