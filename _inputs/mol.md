short_description: Map of Life endeavors to provide ‘best-possible’ species range
  information and species lists for any geographic area
description: Geographic information about biodiversity is vital for understanding
  the many services nature provides and their potential changes, yet remains unreliable
  and often insufficient. Built on a scalable web platform geared for large biodiversity
  and environmental data, Map of Life endeavors to provide ‘best-possible’ species
  range information and species lists for any geographic area. Map of Life aims to
  support effective and global biodiversity education, monitoring, research and decision-making
  by assembling and integrating a wide range of knowledge about species distributions
  and their dynamics over time.
