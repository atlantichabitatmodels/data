short_description: Point counts of breeding birds along transects across North America
description: The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is the primary source of
  long-term, large-scale population data for over 400 breeding bird species. Conducted
  since 1966, this standardized roadside survey relies on volunteer participation.
  It is coordinated in Canada by Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian
  Wildlife Service, in the United States by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, Patuxent
  Wildlife Research Center), and in Mexico by the National Commission for Knowledge
  and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO). One day a year, during the peak of the breeding
  season and for as many years as possible, skilled BBS observers run their assigned
  roadside route(s). Routes consist of 50 stops spaced 0.8 km apart along a 39.4-km
  route. Participants record the total number of individual bird species heard from
  any distance or seen within 0.4 km of each stop during a three-minute observation.
  These data are carefully analyzed on a yearly basis to provide information on bird
  population trends, relative abundance and species composition and richness at the
  local, regional and continental scale. BBS data are freely available, and are used
  by scientists, wildlife managers, educators, and students, as well as by the general
  public.
