    "description": "Understanding the state and trends in agriculture production is essential to combat both short-term and long-term threats to stable and reliable access to food for all, and to ensure a profitable agricultural sector. Starting in 2009, the Earth Observation Team of the Science and Technology Branch (STB) at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) began the process of generating annual crop type digital maps. Focusing on the Prairie Provinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was applied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (Radarsat-2) based satellite images. Beginning with the 2011 growing season, this activity has been extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory. To date this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets the overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of 30m (56m in 2009 and 2010).\n\n\n",

AquaMaps is a joint project of FishBase and SealifeBase.\nAquaMaps is a tool for generating model-based, large-scale predictions of natural occurrences of marine species. The model uses estimates of environmental preferences with respect to depth, water temperature, salinity, primary productivity, dissolved oxygen, and association with sea ice or coastal areas. These estimates of species preferences, called environmental envelopes, are derived from large sets of occurrence data available from online collection databases such as GBIF (gbif.org) and OBIS (obis.org), and from independent knowledge from the literature about the distribution of a given species and its habitat usage that are available in FishBase (www.fishbase.org) and in SeaLifeBase (www.sealifebase.org). The environmental envelopes are matched against local environmental conditions to determine the suitability of a given area in the ocean for a particular species. Predictions of relative probabilities of species occurrence are shown as color-coded species range maps in a global grid of half-degree latitude and longitude cell dimensions. The maps are displayed on the web through the use of C-squares Mapper developed at CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research in Australia (Rees, 2002, 2003). \n",

    "description": "Efforts are underway in Canada to set aside terrestrial lands for conservation, thereby protecting them from anthropogenic pressures. Here we produce the first Canadian human footprint map by combining twelve different anthropogenic pressures and identify intact and modified lands and ecosystems across the country. Our results showed strong spatial variation in pressures across the country, with just 18% of Canada experiencing measurable human pressure. However, some ecosystems are experiencing very high pressure, such as the Great Lakes Plains and Prairies national ecological areas which have over 75% and 56% of their areas, respectively, with a high human footprint. In contrast, the Arctic and Northern Mountains have less than 0.02% and 0.2% of their extent under high human footprint. A validation of the final map, using random statistical sampling, resulted in a Cohen Kappa statistic of 0.91, signifying an ‘almost perfect’ agreement between the human footprint and the validation data set. By increasing the number and accuracy of mapped pressures, our map demonstrates much more widespread pressures in Canada than were indicated by previous global mapping efforts, demonstrating the value in specific national data applications. Ecological areas with immense anthropogenic pressure, highlight challenges that may arise when planning for ecologically representative protected areas.",

During that time there has been plenty of great praise, feedback and emails regarding these efforts in helping to promote Canadian geospatial data and ensuring that everybody in the geomatics community knows where to find data for their projects.\n\nWe started this page in 2010 as a way to collaborate links to all Canadian Open Data (sites that offer data downloads at no cost and without restrictions), free geospatial data, online web mapping applications and other sources of geospatial information (including National, Provincial and Municipal levels).",

To date, over 1,500 FEC plots have been assessed throughout the province using a detailed sampling and assessment protocol (Keys et al. 2007). This has resulted in several publications describing regional forest vegetation types, soil types and ecosites (Keys et al. 2003; Neily et al. 2006, 2007; Keys 2007).\n\nIn 2010, results from 10 years of FEC project work were synthesized to produce a comprehensive provincial FEC guide which is presented in three documents: Forest Ecosystem Classification for Nova Scotia: Part I Vegetation Types (2010); Part II Soil Types (2010); and Part III Ecosites (2010).

One day a year, during the peak of the breeding season and for as many years as possible, skilled BBS observers run their assigned roadside route(s). Routes consist of 50 stops spaced 0.8 km apart along a 39.4-km route. Participants record the total number of individual bird species heard from any distance or seen within 0.4 km of each stop during a three-minute observation. These data are carefully analyzed on a yearly basis to provide information on bird population trends, relative abundance and species composition and richness at the local, regional and continental scale. BBS data are freely available, and are used by scientists, wildlife managers, educators, and students, as well as by the general public.",

Some of these phenomena can be detected directly through remote Earth observation. For instance, forest loss can be tracked by comparing satellite imagery across time, and the distribution of ecosystems and species can directly be detected by the color signatures that characterize them. Species-specific detection is challenging with multispectral data due to the coarse spatial resolution; however, with hyperspectral data (having a high spectral resolution), the unique spectral fingerprint each species has can provide species-specific information for vegetation mapping and individual species identification.",

The tool allows users to input ground-truthed passability scores for dams, culverts and other crossings, and prioritize barriers that will have the greatest positive impact for fish and other aquatic wildlife if removed or restored. Users can choose the scale at which they run analyses (e.g. local catchment, primary watershed, entire province, etc.), as well as the ecological communities to benefit from restoration activities (e.g. diadromous fish, resident species). Additionally, 34 different metrics are available for custom-designed scenarios, allowing users to define their own priorities.",

    "description": "NCC's Active River Area for the Northern Appalachian - Acadian Region. Conserving and restoring healthy stream and river ecosystems requires an integrated approach that not only focuses on the streams and rivers themselves, but also incorporates adjacent floodplains and riparian areas and the dynamic processes that directly link the two. Examples of these natural processes include hydrologic flow regime, sediment transport, turnover of organic matter, habitat connectivity, and maintaining water quality, among others. While the type and degree of influence that these processes have on streams and rivers varies in both time and space, by spatially delineating the full range of landscape features that contribute to these processes, the ARA provides a framework for conserving and restoring the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems. For more background information on the original Active River Area project, including applications and utility, please refer to The Active River Area: A Conservation Framework for Protecting Rivers and Streams (Smith et al., 2008).",

The Freshwater Conservation Blueprint is composed of five planning tools: (1) a stream and river ecosystem classification (2) a watershed health assessment; (3) an aquatic connectivity tool; (4) an Active River Area delineation; (5) a freshwater resilience assessment. These tools collectively aim to assist in setting freshwater conservation and restoration priorities throughout the region, and to promote on-the-ground (and in-the-water) action. All these tools are designed to be applicable at multiple spatial scales, from individual watershed, to the provincial level, and to the region as a whole. We envision the Freshwater Conservation Blueprint enabling organizations of all sizes and mandates to work collaboratively using a common language and consistent data to help guide freshwater conservation and management.",

Based largely on data from the Landsat series of satellites, free and open access to analysis ready data, and utilization of high performance computing, NTEMS enabled the recreation of the history of Canada's forests at a higher level of spatial and categorical detail than ever before. Through NTEMS research, methods have been developed for image compositing, change detection, and change attribution using Landsat time series data. NTEMS outputs have subsequently enabled the characterization of post-disturbance recovery, an annual land cover data cube, and national representations of forest structure.

    "description": "The UBC Fish Collection holds over 850,000 specimens and over 50,000 DNA and tissue samples making it the third-largest fish collection in Canada. These fish specimens are described in over 11,200 records that contain data on species co-occurrences and habitat and environmental conditions associated with each collection over a more than 100 year period. The \"fish notebooks\" that contain these collection records provide an invaluable biological time series and context for each collection. The data have been used in environmental assessments, conservation efforts, and numerous research projects such as documenting regime shifts in the Bering Sea, the formation of new species, and the extinction of others as well as in educating and training some of Canada's leading fish biologists. This digitization project make this data globally accessible. See more about the Fish Collection at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum.",
