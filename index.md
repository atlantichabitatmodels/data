### Welcome to the Atlantic Canada Species At Risk Habitat Modelling Data Catalogue

This is a product that has been developed by the [Atlantic Canada Species At Risk Modelling Data Sharing Working Group](https://atlantichabitatmodels.github.io/communityofpractice/data-sharing/).

Our objective is to make it easier for model builders to find the data they need to produce high-quality products that can be used to support the conservation of Species At Risk in our region.

More specifically, we hope that this data catalogue will:
Facilitate awareness of modelling datasets
Provide guidance on appropriate use of datasets
Ensure data is accessible for use in models

[**Please help us by contributing to this resource**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GZKDpZa18Ga0irokXhh-1ZUyF3TPi0Jl_yG4NrdVlk/edit#gid=1416728414)

This prototype site currently provides access to model data inputs. We hope to eventually expand our scope to data outputs (like the models themselves).
